# Tests for Nabto's Cordova Plugin

Apparently Cordova no longer supports a sub-project for tests, so the Cordova Nabto plugin tests have been moved to this separate repo.

Build a test app that uses the Cordova unit test runner and run the tests using `./scripts/cdv-plugin-build.sh`, for instance:

```ShellSession
./scripts/cdv-plugin-build.sh ios clean
```

See the test section in the README of the Nabto Cordova plugin for further info: https://github.com/nabto/cordova-plugin-nabto.
